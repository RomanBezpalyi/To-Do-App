# MyToDo

The application allows user to note his tasks to do, tracking their progress.
The app is developed using MVC pattern. All user's tasks are stored in local storage.

To add your task, push 'Create' button and fill the title, description, and priority fields.
You can update your task's progress status, its title or description, or delete it via '...' button.
All tasks can be filtered using selects in the app's header. Also, there is an ability to search a task by its title using 'Search by title' input.
